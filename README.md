                       Overview
                                                                                          
Dataset Overview
Data Analysis and Preprocessing
Feature Selection
Determining Test Size Using Cross-Validation Score

Comparison & Conclusion

                  Data Analysis and Preprocessing
                                                                           

Check if there any Null values
Check the Duplicate values in each rows and columns
Check Unique values for each Attributes
Check Outlier by plotting and counting 
Check the Correlation between the attributes those have large number of outlier and Target attribute
Handle the Outlier with threshold
Replace Null values with mean

                 Feature Selection
                                                                                   
Check the Correlation of Target attribute and the remaining attributes
Combining SelectKBest with ExtraTreesClassifier
Used Ranking of features using SelectionKBest
After observing these three processes, we can see that all features should be included in model training.
